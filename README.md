A from-scratch linear regression model to predict BWF (Badminton World Federation) player rankings using player statistics.

## Project Overview

This project implements linear regression from the ground up using only NumPy and Pandas to predict badminton player rankings. The model predicts a player's rank based on their prize money, win rate, and tournament points.

## Dataset

- **Source**: BWF Men's Doubles Rankings (2016 Week 7)
- **Original size**: 1,418 players
- **Final dataset**: 227 players (after cleaning and outlier removal)
- **Features**: Prize Money, Win Rate, Points, Rank

## Features Used

1. **Prize Money**: Total career prize money earned (scaled 0-1)
2. **Win Rate**: Wins/(Wins + Losses) from match history (0-1)
3. **Points**: BWF ranking points earned (scaled 0-1)
4. **Target**: Player rank (1 = best, higher numbers = worse ranking)

## Data Preprocessing

- Cleaned prize money strings (removed $ and commas)
- Calculated win rate from "WIN - LOSE" format
- Extracted points from "POINTS / TOURNAMENTS" format
- Removed players with $0 prize money (inactive/new players)
- Filtered to top 300 ranked players only
- Removed outliers using 5th/95th percentile filtering
- Scaled all features to 0-1 range for consistent learning

## Model Implementation

Built entirely from scratch without scikit-learn:

### Linear Regression Equation
```
predicted_rank = bias + w1×prize_money + w2×win_rate + w3×points
```

### Key Functions
- **Prediction**: Matrix multiplication (X @ weights)
- **Cost Function**: Mean Squared Error 
- **Gradients**: Partial derivatives for weight updates
- **Gradient Descent**: Iterative weight optimization

### Training Parameters
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Iterations**: 15,000
- **Optimization**: Gradient descent with MSE loss

## Results

### Model Performance
- **Initial Cost**: 30,947
- **Final Cost**: 2,621
- **Average Error**: ±51 ranks
- **Systematic Bias**: 2.8 ranks (model slightly optimistic)


## Key Findings

1. **Points are most predictive**: Largest weight magnitude (-134.86)
2. **Prize money helps**: Negative correlation as expected
3. **Win rate counterintuitive**: Positive weight suggests complexity in data
4. **Model generalizes well**: Reasonable predictions across rank ranges

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling messy real-world sports data
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful predictors from raw data
- **Linear Algebra**: Matrix operations for predictions and gradients
- **Optimization**: Implementing gradient descent from scratch
- **Statistical Analysis**: Understanding bias, variance, and model evaluation

## Files

- `badminton.ipynb`: Complete analysis and model implementation
- `bwf_md_2016w7.csv`: Original BWF rankings dataset
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation

## Future Improvements

- Implement train/test split for better generalization testing
- Add regularization (L1/L2) to prevent overfitting
- Try polynomial features for non-linear relationships
- Cross-validation for more robust performance estimates
- Feature selection to identify most important predictors

## Dependencies

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

## Usage

1. Load and clean the BWF rankings data
2. Engineer features (win rate, points extraction)
3. Remove outliers and scale features
4. Train linear regression model with gradient descent
5. Evaluate predictions and analyze results

## Conclusion

Successfully built a working rank prediction system achieving ±51 rank accuracy on badminton player rankings. The from-scratch implementation demonstrates solid understanding of machine learning fundamentals and practical data science skills.
